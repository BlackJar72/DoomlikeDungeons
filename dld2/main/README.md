# Doomlike Dungeons II

This is content for Doomlike Dungeons II.  It may remain separate as an 
add-on (in which case it will have different name), but most likely will 
be merged with Doomlike Dungeons in the future to make Doomlike Dungeons II. 
In the mean time it allow me to keep new content separate from the main 
mod and to do so in a way more conducive to this project that a branch, 
and more flexible to future design (i.e., it could be a sequel or an 
addon).
