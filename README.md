# DoomlikeDungeons

I'm just now trying to start learning Git / GitHub and this is is my first repository, so please be patient!

Binaries and general information can be found here:

For now, this project is under GPL version 2.0 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html), though I may change to a more permissive license later.
