# DoomlikeDungeons

This mod will add dungeons meant to resemble levels from classic "2 1/2d" fisrt-person shooters and rpgs, and was inspired by earlier dungeons mods and by Oblige (especially version 3.57), a random level generator for Doom. The goal is to create interesting, tactically challenging, and highly varied multi-room dungeons that are fun to explore and rewarding to conquer.

Versions found here will often be development versions.  That is, "1.6.2" when written in source files really means something like "1.6.1.x-pre1.6.2" unless looking under a specific previous release.

Note that in Minecraft 1.12.2 or newer you may get some "Cascading Worldgen" warnings.  This is the results of intended behavior; its a design flaw but not actually a bug.  There is no cascading chain reaction.


This really is almost certainly the final version of this mod -- even if I update to the next game version it will not be with no feature or a new mod version.  Any further development, if any, will go into a sequel written from scratch to do something right that Doomlike Dungeons simply does wrong.
