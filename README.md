# DoomlikeDungeons

I'm just now trying to start learning Git / GitHub and this is is my first repository, so please be patient!

Binaries and general information can be found here:

http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293843-doomlike-dungeons-1-6-1

Version found here will often be development versions.  That is, "1.6.2" really means something like "1.6.1.x-pre1.6.2" unless looking under a specific previous release.
