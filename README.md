# DoomlikeDungeons

This mod will add dungeons meant to resemble levels from classic "2 1/2d" fisrt-person shooters and rpgs, and was inspired by earlier dungeons mods and by Oblige (especially version 3.57), a random level generator for Doom. The goal is to create interesting, tactically challenging, and highly varied multi-room dungeons that are fun to explore and rewarding to conquer.

Versions found here will often be development versions.  That is, "1.6.2" when written in source files really means something like "1.6.1.x-pre1.6.2" unless looking under a specific previous release.
