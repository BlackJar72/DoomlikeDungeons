# DoomlikeDungeons

This mod will add dungeons meant to resemble levels from classic "2 1/2d" fisrt-person shooters and rpgs, and was inspired by earlier dungeons mods and by Oblige (especially version 3.57), a random level generator for Doom. The goal is to create interesting, tactically challenging, and highly varied multi-room dungeons that are fun to explore and rewarding to conquer.

# This is now a dead mod (or abandonware, if you prefer).

After waiting half a year to fix things that should have been fixed a year before that, and now not really even playing the game much, and having done basically what I wanted to do, and getting tired of this, I think its time.  No more talking about hypothetical features that I'll probably never do or promising future updates I may or may not do, or may not do quickly.  Thank you for all the support and appreciation to those who enjoyed this mod since it began three years ago back in the spring of 2014.  Everything should be good until Minecraft 1.12 or more become common for mods.  All the source is on GitHub if anyone want to update this or make their own changes.  This is probably a long delayed goodbye to the world of Minecraft, which I found four years ago and took up more of my time than any game should for the first couple.  And to those still playing this, have fun!

Versions found here will often be development versions.  That is, "1.6.2" when written in source files really means something like "1.6.1.x-pre1.6.2" unless looking under a specific previous release.
