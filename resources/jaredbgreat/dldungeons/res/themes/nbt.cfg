#Each line is has the following components:
#label type name data
#
#label is what you use to add it to an itam or combine it with othe tags (must be unique)
#type is the NBT data type -- and valid type but list can be used
#name is the name of the data field in the NBT file
#data is what it holds
#
#I'm not giving a full NBT course here -- I'm just learning that myself, but below are some examples.
#More info can be found online in places such as the Minecraft Wiki
#This is a good start: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Player.dat_format#Item_structure
#
#Whether or not this might latter be applicable to blocks or mobs has not been decided; 
#For now NBT can only be used for loot items.
#
#In addition to normal NBT tags there is an Ench tag as a convenience for enchanting...
#label ench anything id.lvl
#...and a Group options that simply allows several additions to be put into on label.

#WARNING: This can be easy to mess-up, and there is no error checking (but the game may crash on start-up)
